Set up a ProxyVM as a VPN gateway using iptables and CLI scripts
----------------------------------------------------------------

(stolen from https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/docs/configuration/vpn.md)


This method is more involved than the one above, but has anti-leak features that also make the connection _fail closed_ should it be interrupted.
It has been tested with Fedora 30 and Debian 10 templates.

Before proceeding, you will need to download a copy of your VPN provider's configuration file(s) and have your VPN login information handy.

1. Create a new VM, name it, choose "provides network", and choose a color and template.


   Note: Do not enable NetworkManager in the ProxyVM, as it can interfere with the scripts' DNS features.
   If you enabled NetworkManager or used other methods in a previous attempt, do not re-use the old ProxyVM...
   Create a new one according to this step.

   If your choice of TemplateVM doesn't already have the VPN client software, you'll need to install the software in the template before proceeding. The 'openvpn' package comes installed in the Fedora template, and in Debian it can be installed with the following command:

       sudo apt-get install openvpn

   Disable any auto-starting service that comes with the software package.
   For example for OpenVPN.

       sudo systemctl disable openvpn-server@.service
       sudo systemctl disable openvpn-client@.service

2. Set up and test the VPN client.
   Make sure the VPN VM and its TemplateVM is not running.
   Run a terminal (CLI) in the VPN VM -- this will start the VM.
   Then create a new `/rw/config/vpn` folder with:

       sudo mkdir /rw/config/vpn

   Copy your VPN configuration files to `/rw/config/vpn`.
   Your VPN config file should be named `openvpn-client.ovpn` so you can use the scripts below as is without modification. Otherwise you would have to replace the file name. Files accompanying the main config such as `*.crt` and `*.pem` should also be placed in the `/rw/config/vpn` folder.

   Check or modify configuration file contents using a text editor:

       sudo gedit /rw/config/vpn/openvpn-client.ovpn

   Files referenced in `openvpn-client.ovpn` should not use absolute paths such as `/etc/...`.

   The config should route all traffic through your VPN's interface after a connection is created; For OpenVPN the directive for this is `redirect-gateway def1`.

   Make sure it already includes or add:

       redirect-gateway def1

   The VPN client may not be able to prompt you for credentials when connecting to the server, so we'll add a reference to a file containing the VPN username and password.
   For example for OpenVPN, add or modify `auth-user-pass` like so:

       auth-user-pass pass.txt

   Save the `/rw/config/vpn/openvpn-client.ovpn` file.

   Now make sure a `/rw/config/vpn/pass.txt` file actually exists.

       sudo gedit /rw/config/vpn/pass.txt

   Add:

       username
       password

   Replace `username` and `password` with your actual username and password.

   **Test your client configuration:**
   Run the client from a CLI prompt in the 'vpn' folder, preferably as root.
   For example:

       sudo openvpn --cd /rw/config/vpn --config openvpn-client.ovpn

   Watch for status messages that indicate whether the connection is successful and test from another VPN VM terminal window with `ping`.

       ping 1.1.1.1

   `ping` can be aborted by pressing the two keys `ctrl` + `c` at the same time.
   DNS may be tested at this point by replacing addresses in `/etc/resolv.conf` with ones appropriate for your VPN (although this file will not be used when setup is complete).
   Diagnose any connection problems using resources such as client documentation and help from your VPN service provider.
   Proceed to the next step when you're sure the basic VPN connection is working.

3. Create the DNS-handling script.

       sudo gedit /rw/config/vpn/qubes-vpn-handler.sh

   Add the following:

   ~~~
   #!/bin/bash
   set -e
   export PATH="$PATH:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
  
   case "$1" in
  
   up)
   # To override DHCP DNS, assign DNS addresses to 'vpn_dns' env variable before calling this script;
   # Format is 'X.X.X.X  Y.Y.Y.Y [...]'
   if [[ -z "$vpn_dns" ]] ; then
       # Parses DHCP foreign_option_* vars to automatically set DNS address translation:
       for optionname in ${!foreign_option_*} ; do
           option="${!optionname}"
           unset fops; fops=($option)
           if [ ${fops[1]} == "DNS" ] ; then vpn_dns="$vpn_dns ${fops[2]}" ; fi
       done
   fi
  
   iptables -t nat -F PR-QBS
   if [[ -n "$vpn_dns" ]] ; then
       # Set DNS address translation in firewall:
       for addr in $vpn_dns; do
           iptables -t nat -A PR-QBS -i vif+ -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to $addr
           iptables -t nat -A PR-QBS -i vif+ -p tcp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to $addr
       done
       su - -c 'notify-send "$(hostname): LINK IS UP." --icon=network-idle' user
   else
       su - -c 'notify-send "$(hostname): LINK UP, NO DNS!" --icon=dialog-error' user
   fi
  
   ;;
   down)
   su - -c 'notify-send "$(hostname): LINK IS DOWN !" --icon=dialog-error' user
   
   # Restart the VPN automatically
   sleep 5s
   sudo /rw/config/rc.local
   ;;
   esac
   ~~~

   Save the script.
   Make it executable.

       sudo chmod +x /rw/config/vpn/qubes-vpn-handler.sh

4. Configure client to use the DNS handling script. Using openvpn as an example, edit the config.

       sudo gedit /rw/config/vpn/openvpn-client.ovpn

   Add the following.

       script-security 2
       up 'qubes-vpn-handler.sh up'
       down 'qubes-vpn-handler.sh down'

   Remove other instances of lines starting with `script-security`, `up` or `down` should there be any others.
   Save the script.
   **Restart the client and test the connection again** ...this time from an AppVM!

5. Set up iptables anti-leak rules.
   Edit the firewall script.

       sudo gedit /rw/config/qubes-firewall-user-script

   Clear out the existing lines and add:

   ~~~
   #!/bin/bash
   #    Block forwarding of connections through upstream network device
   #    (in case the vpn tunnel breaks):
   iptables -I FORWARD -o eth0 -j DROP
   iptables -I FORWARD -i eth0 -j DROP
   ip6tables -I FORWARD -o eth0 -j DROP
   ip6tables -I FORWARD -i eth0 -j DROP
   
   #    Accept traffic to VPN
   iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
   iptables -F OUTPUT
   
   #    Add the `qvpn` group to system, if it doesn't already exist
   if ! grep -q "^qvpn:" /etc/group ; then
        groupadd -rf qvpn
        sync
   fi
   sleep 2s
   
   #    Block non-VPN traffic to clearnet
   iptables -I OUTPUT -o eth0 -j DROP
   #    Allow traffic from the `qvpn` group to the uplink interface (eth0);
   #    Our VPN client will run with group `qvpn`.
   iptables -I OUTPUT -p all -o eth0 -m owner --gid-owner qvpn -j ACCEPT
   ~~~

   Save the script.
   Make it executable.

       sudo chmod +x /rw/config/qubes-firewall-user-script

5. Set up the VPN's autostart.

       sudo gedit /rw/config/rc.local

   Clear out the existing lines and add:

   ~~~
   #!/bin/bash
   VPN_CLIENT='openvpn'
   VPN_OPTIONS='--cd /rw/config/vpn/ --config openvpn-client.ovpn --daemon'
   
   groupadd -rf qvpn ; sleep 2s
   sg qvpn -c "$VPN_CLIENT $VPN_OPTIONS"
   su - -c 'notify-send "$(hostname): Starting $VPN_CLIENT..." --icon=network-idle' user
   ~~~

   If you are using anything other than OpenVPN, change the `VPN_CLIENT` and `VPN_OPTIONS` variables to match your VPN software.
   Save the script.
   Make it executable.

       sudo chmod +x /rw/config/rc.local

6. Restart the new VM!
   The link should then be established automatically with a popup notification to that effect.


Usage
-----

Configure your AppVMs to use the VPN VM as a NetVM...

If you want to update your TemplateVMs through the VPN, you can enable the `qubes-updates-proxy` service for your new VPN VM and configure the [qubes-rpc policy](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-domu/#updates-proxy).
